# Repository Overview

This repository has all the components—models, instances, and results—related to the confirmatory experiments conducted for my Master of Science in Computer Science Thesis Research. Each primary element (Instances, Models, and Results) is organized within its dedicated directory, detailed as follows:

## Instances

The `Instances` directory is subdivided into two main folders and contains additional CSV files:

- **Test**: This folder holds all the KP (Knapsack Problem) instances utilized for testing the models.
- **Train**: Contains all the KP instances used for training in the context of offline supervised learning models.
- Additionally, two CSV files, generated by PHERMES, can be found here. These files serve as the KP instance Test and Train libraries, respectively, each characterized and evaluated by simple heuristics.

## Models

The `Models` directory encompasses two specific folders alongside a csv file comparator and includes:

- **PHERMES_CCA**: Contains the PHERMES infrastructure along with the CCA (Classification Cellular Automaton) and other classifiers for comparison purposes.

- **CAHH-Wolfram & PBMH**: They are presented as unique notebooks and hence are not situated within an inner directory.

- **Results_Analyzers**: This folder contains files that assist in generating CSV datasets with aggregated results for further analysis. A rival Genetic Algorithm (GA) is also included for comparison with the PBMH model.

## Results

Results are meticulously organized by the three models proposed in my thesis. Within each model's folder, you can find:

- The results derived from each model.
- Comparisons drawn from the Results Analyzers.
- Any plots generated from each model's analysis.

This structure aims to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of the experimental framework and outcomes of my thesis research.
